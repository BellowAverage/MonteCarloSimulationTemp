## Project Overview

This baseball simulation project aims to create a realistic simulation of baseball games using historical data. The project demonstrates best practices in:
- Project organization and documentation
- AI-assisted development
- Data processing and preparation
- Simulation implementation
- Results analysis and visualization

## Getting Started

[Instructions for setting up and running the simulation will be added as the project progresses]

## AI Collaboration

This project includes transparent documentation of AI collaboration in the development process. All AI contributions and interactions are documented in the project management artifacts for reproducibility and reflection purposes.

## Data Sources

The simulation uses data from Baseball-Reference.com, including:
- Player statistics
- Team rosters
- Game schedules

## Project Management

The project follows a structured approach to development and documentation. All project management artifacts are stored in the `documentation_and_project_management_artifacts` directory, providing a clear record of the development process and decision-making.
