# Baseball Simulation - Functional Specifications

## Overview
This document outlines the functional requirements and acceptance criteria for the baseball simulation project.

## User Stories

### 1. Game Simulation
As a user, I want to:
- Simulate a complete baseball game between two teams
- View detailed play-by-play results
- See final game statistics and box scores
- Run Monte Carlo simulations for multiple game outcomes

Acceptance Criteria:
- Simulation follows official baseball rules
- All basic game events are supported (hits, walks, strikeouts, etc.)
- Statistics are accurately calculated and displayed
- Results are reproducible given the same input parameters
- Monte Carlo simulations can run multiple iterations with different random seeds

### 2. Team Management
As a user, I want to:
- Load real team rosters from historical data
- View team statistics and player information
- Make lineup and pitching rotation decisions

Acceptance Criteria:
- Teams can be loaded from prepared data files
- Player statistics are accurately represented
- Lineup changes are properly validated
- Pitching rotations follow realistic rules

### 3. Season Simulation
As a user, I want to:
- Simulate a complete MLB season
